            <p1>Stock options aren't actual shares of stockâ€”they're the right to buy a set number of company shares at a fixed price, usually called a grant price, strike price, or exercise price.</p1>
            <p2>Stock options give a trader the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell shares of a certain stock at an agreed-upon price and date. Stock options are a common form of equity derivative. One equity options contract generally represents 100 shares of the underlying stock.</p2>
            <p3> Stocks offer high-risk, high-reward potential, while options take that a couple notches higher, with the possibility to double or triple your money (or more) at the risk of losing it all, often in the matter of a few weeks or months.</p3>
